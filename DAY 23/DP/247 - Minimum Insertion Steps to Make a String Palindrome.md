# [1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertion-steps-to-make-a-string-palindrome/description/)

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of insertions required to make a given string a palindrome. The challenge is to transform the string with the fewest steps (insertions) so that it reads the same backward and forward.

### Approach:
This problem is essentially about finding how far the string is from being a palindrome and figuring out how to minimize the number of insertions required to achieve this.

### Key Insight:
The minimum number of insertions required to make a string a palindrome is closely related to finding the **Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)**. If we can find the LPS, the rest of the characters (outside the LPS) need to be inserted to make the string a palindrome.

Thus, the number of insertions required is the difference between the length of the string and the length of the LPS:
\[
\text{insertions} = \text{length of the string} - \text{LPS length}
\]

### Steps:
1. **Finding the LPS**: 
   - This can be done by computing the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** between the string `s` and its reverse `rev_s`.
   - The reason LCS works here is that the longest subsequence common to both `s` and `rev_s` would also be the longest palindromic subsequence in `s`.

2. **DP Table**:
   - We'll use dynamic programming to compute the LCS between `s` and `rev_s`.

### Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def minInsertions(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Reverse of the input string
        rev_s = s[::-1]
        n = len(s)
        
        # DP table where dp[i][j] stores the LCS length between s[0:i] and rev_s[0:j]
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        # Fill the DP table
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if s[i - 1] == rev_s[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
        # The minimum number of insertions to make the string a palindrome
        lps_length = dp[n][n]
        return n - lps_length
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reverse of the string**: We first reverse the string `s` and call it `rev_s`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS between the first `i` characters of `s` and the first `j` characters of `rev_s`.
   - If `s[i-1] == rev_s[j-1]`, then we add 1 to the LCS found by excluding the current characters, i.e., `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, we take the maximum LCS possible by either excluding the current character from `s` or from `rev_s`, i.e., `max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
3. **Result**: After filling the DP table, the value `dp[n][n]` will give us the length of the LPS. The minimum number of insertions needed to make `s` a palindrome is `n - dp[n][n]`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. We fill a DP table of size \(n \times n\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), due to the space required for the DP table.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
s = "zzazz"
rev_s = "zzazz"
```
- The LCS between `s` and `rev_s` is the entire string itself ("zzazz").
- Therefore, the minimum number of insertions is `n - LPS length = 5 - 5 = 0`.

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
s = "mbadm"
rev_s = "mdabm"
```
- The LCS between `s` and `rev_s` is "madm".
- Therefore, the minimum number of insertions is `5 - 3 = 2`.

#### Example 3:
```plaintext
s = "leetcode"
rev_s = "edocteel"
```
- The LCS between `s` and `rev_s` is "ete".
- Therefore, the minimum number of insertions is `8 - 3 = 5`.

This approach ensures that we can determine the minimum number of insertions required to make the string a palindrome efficiently, even for strings of length up to 500.
