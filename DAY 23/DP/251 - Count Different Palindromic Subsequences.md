# [730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-different-palindromic-subsequences/description/)

It seems like your message got cut off. Let's continue with the approach for solving the problem using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

### Plan:

We will use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in the substring `s[i:j]` (inclusive). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Base Case**:
   - If `i == j`, meaning the substring is a single character, there is exactly 1 palindromic subsequence (the character itself).
   - Therefore, `dp[i][i] = 1`.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, the subsequences starting and ending with `s[i]` or `s[j]` can form new palindromic subsequences. To handle this case:
     - We include the subsequences formed between `i + 1` and `j - 1` and consider adding `s[i]` and `s[j]` to them.
     - We also need to handle duplicates carefully. For example, if there are repeated characters inside the substring `s[i+1:j-1]` (like `s[i]` or `s[j]`), we need to exclude the repeated subsequences that have already been counted.
   - If `s[i] != s[j]`, then the number of distinct palindromic subsequences between `s[i:j]` is the sum of the subsequences for `s[i+1:j]` and `s[i:j-1]`, but subtracting the overlapping subsequences in `s[i+1:j-1]` (i.e., `dp[i+1][j-1]`).

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the result can be very large, every result needs to be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize a 2D DP array of size \(n \times n\) (where \(n\) is the length of the string) with zeros.
2. Fill in the base cases where each character is its own palindromic subsequence.
3. For each possible length of the substring, compute the number of distinct palindromic subsequences using the recursive case described above.
4. Return `dp[0][n-1]`, which will contain the count of distinct palindromic subsequences for the entire string.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def countPalindromicSubsequences(self, s: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Base case: single character palindromes
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1
        
        # Iterate over the lengths of the substring
        for length in range(2, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    # s[i] == s[j], consider all palindromes between i+1 and j-1
                    left, right = i + 1, j - 1
                    
                    # Find the first occurrence of s[i] in range (i+1, j)
                    while left <= right and s[left] != s[i]:
                        left += 1
                    # Find the last occurrence of s[i] in range (i, j-1)
                    while left <= right and s[right] != s[i]:
                        right -= 1
                    
                    if left > right:
                        # Case 1: No occurrences of s[i] inside s[i+1:j-1]
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] * 2 + 2
                    elif left == right:
                        # Case 2: One occurrence of s[i] inside s[i+1:j-1]
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] * 2 + 1
                    else:
                        # Case 3: Two or more occurrences of s[i] inside s[i+1:j-1]
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] * 2 - dp[left+1][right-1]
                else:
                    # s[i] != s[j], so consider the distinct subsequences from both sides
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i+1][j-1]
                
                # Ensure the result is within bounds of MOD
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + MOD) % MOD
        
        return dp[0][n-1]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a DP array `dp` of size \(n \times n\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. All entries are initialized to 0.
   - Each single character is its own palindromic subsequence, so `dp[i][i] = 1` for each `i`.

2. **DP Transitions**:
   - For each length of substring from 2 to \(n\), we compute the number of distinct palindromic subsequences by comparing the characters at both ends (`s[i]` and `s[j]`).
   - If they are equal, we calculate the number of subsequences in the inner substring `s[i+1:j-1]` and adjust based on occurrences of `s[i]` inside the substring.
   - If they are different, we sum up the subsequences from the substrings `s[i+1:j]` and `s[i:j-1]` while subtracting the overlapping subsequences.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - To avoid overflow, we take every result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating over all possible pairs of `i` and `j`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\), as we use a 2D DP table to store results for all substrings.

### Example:

For `s = "bccb"`, the distinct palindromic subsequences are `b`, `c`, `bb`, `cc`, `bcb`, and `bccb`, so the output is 6.

For `s = "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba"`, the output is `104860361` after modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
