# [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/description/)

To determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome, you need an efficient approach both in terms of time and space. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward, so the solution involves checking if the list's first half matches the reversed second half.

## Approach

1. **Find the Middle of the Linked List**:
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle node of the linked list.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**:
   - Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the middle node.

3. **Compare the Two Halves**:
   - Compare the nodes of the first half with the nodes of the reversed second half.

4. **Restore the List (Optional)**:
   - If needed, restore the original order of the linked list by reversing the second half again.

### Steps

1. **Find the Middle**:
   - Use two pointers: `slow` and `fast`. Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**:
   - Starting from the middle, reverse the second half of the linked list.

3. **Compare**:
   - Compare nodes of the first half and the reversed second half.

4. **Restore the List (Optional)**:
   - Reverse the second half again to restore the list if you want to maintain the original structure.


## Implementation

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not head or not head.next:
            return True
        
        # Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
        def findMiddle(head):
            slow = head
            fast = head
            while fast and fast.next:
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next.next
            return slow
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
        def reverse(head):
            prev = None
            current = head
            while current:
                next_node = current.next
                current.next = prev
                prev = current
                current = next_node
            return prev
        
        # Find the middle of the list
        middle = findMiddle(head)
        
        # Reverse the second half
        second_half = reverse(middle)
        
        # Compare the first half and the reversed second half
        first_half = head
        while second_half:
            if first_half.val != second_half.val:
                return False
            first_half = first_half.next
            second_half = second_half.next
        
        return True
```

### Explanation

1. **Finding the Middle**:
   - The `findMiddle` function uses the slow and fast pointers to find the midpoint of the linked list.

2. **Reversing the Second Half**:
   - The `reverse` function reverses the linked list starting from the middle.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Compare each node from the start and the reversed second half to check for palindrome property.
  
## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures that the linked list is processed in linear time with constant space, making it both efficient and suitable for large lists.
