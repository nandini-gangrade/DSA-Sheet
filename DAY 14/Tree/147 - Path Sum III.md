# [437. Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/)

To solve the problem of counting the number of paths in a binary tree that sum up to a given `targetSum`, we need to consider paths that can start and end at any node but must travel downwards from parent to child. We can use a combination of Depth-First Search (DFS) and a hash map to efficiently find and count these paths.

### Approach

1. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Traverse each node using DFS.
   - For each node, compute the number of paths that start from that node and have a sum equal to `targetSum`.

2. **Prefix Sum Technique**:
   - Use a hash map to store the cumulative sums of paths as we traverse.
   - For each node, calculate the cumulative sum from the root to that node. Check if there exists a path with the sum equal to `targetSum` by using the hash map.
   - Update the hash map to include the current node's cumulative sum.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a recursive function to count the number of valid paths from the current node that sum up to `targetSum`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Use a hash map to keep track of the cumulative sums. For each node, update the hash map and check for valid paths using the difference between the current cumulative sum and `targetSum`.

3. **Handle Multiple Paths**:
   - Call the recursive function for each node, and count paths starting from that node.

### Code Implementation

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> int:
        def dfs(node, current_sum):
            if not node:
                return 0

            current_sum += node.val
            count = prefix_sum_count[current_sum - targetSum]
            prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1

            count += dfs(node.left, current_sum)
            count += dfs(node.right, current_sum)

            prefix_sum_count[current_sum] -= 1
            return count
        
        prefix_sum_count = defaultdict(int)
        prefix_sum_count[0] = 1  # Base case: A path with sum 0 is considered valid
        return dfs(root, 0)
```

### Explanation

1. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function explores each node, updating the cumulative path sum and checking how many paths (using prefix sums) match the `targetSum`.

2. **Hash Map**:
   - The `prefix_sum_count` keeps track of the number of times a particular cumulative sum has occurred. This allows efficient lookup for how many times a path with the required sum has occurred.

3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes, because each node is visited once.
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for the hash map storing prefix sums.

This approach efficiently counts the number of paths with a sum equal to `targetSum` in the given binary tree.
