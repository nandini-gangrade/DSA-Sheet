# [1134. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/description/)

To solve this problem, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is a classical algorithm for finding shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This algorithm is particularly well-suited for the constraints of this problem since it works efficiently for graphs with up to 100 vertices.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Distance Matrix**: 
   - Create a matrix `dist` of size `n x n` where `dist[i][j]` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`), except for `dist[i][i]` which is set to 0 (since the distance from a node to itself is 0).
   - Update the matrix with the weights of the given edges.

2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - Update the distance matrix using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which checks for each pair of cities if a shorter path exists via an intermediate city `k`.

3. **Count Reachable Cities**:
   - For each city, count the number of other cities that are reachable within the given `distanceThreshold`.

4. **Find the Result**:
   - Track the city with the minimum number of reachable cities. In case of a tie, select the city with the greatest index.

### Implementation

Here's how we can implement the above approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheCity(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], distanceThreshold: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Initialize the distance matrix
        dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Distance from a node to itself is 0
        for i in range(n):
            dist[i][i] = 0
        
        # Update the matrix with edge weights
        for u, v, w in edges:
            dist[u][v] = w
            dist[v][u] = w
        
        # Step 2: Apply the Floyd-Warshall algorithm
        for k in range(n):
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                        dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
        
        # Step 3: Count reachable cities for each city
        min_reachable = float('inf')
        result_city = -1
        
        for i in range(n):
            reachable = 0
            for j in range(n):
                if i != j and dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold:
                    reachable += 1
            
            # Step 4: Find the city with the smallest number of reachable cities
            # In case of tie, choose the city with the greater index
            if reachable <= min_reachable:
                min_reachable = reachable
                result_city = i
        
        return result_city

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.findTheCity(4, [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], 4))  # Output: 3
print(sol.findTheCity(5, [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], 2))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: We start with an `n x n` matrix to store distances between every pair of cities, initialized to infinity, except the diagonal (same city pairs), which is initialized to zero.
  
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to update the matrix such that `dist[i][j]` contains the shortest path from city `i` to city `j`.

- **Reachability Count**: For each city, we count how many other cities can be reached within the distance threshold.

- **Result Determination**: Finally, we track the city with the fewest reachable cities, and in case of a tie, we choose the city with the greatest index.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and makes good use of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to handle the complete graph with all possible paths.
