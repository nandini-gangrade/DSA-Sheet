# [Minimize Cash Flow among a given set of friends who have borrowed money from each other](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimize-cash-flow-among-given-set-friends-borrowed-money/)

To minimize the cash flow among a set of friends who have borrowed money from each other, you can use a greedy algorithm that repeatedly settles the largest creditor and debtor. Here's a step-by-step guide to the approach, followed by the Python implementation.

### Algorithm Explanation

1. **Calculate Net Amount for Each Person**:
   - For each person, compute the net amount by subtracting the total amount they owe from the total amount they are owed. This will give you a list where positive values represent creditors and negative values represent debtors.

2. **Find Maximum Creditor and Maximum Debtor**:
   - Identify the person with the maximum net credit (maximum positive value) and the person with the maximum net debt (maximum negative value).

3. **Settle the Maximum Creditor and Debtor**:
   - Determine the minimum of the two amounts (credit and debit). This is the amount that will be settled in this step.
   - Adjust the amounts for the creditor and debtor based on this settlement.

4. **Update and Recur**:
   - If the debtor’s amount becomes zero, remove the debtor from the list of people to settle.
   - If the creditor’s amount becomes zero, remove the creditor from the list of people to settle.
   - Recur with the updated list of people.

5. **Repeat Until All Debts Are Settled**:
   - Continue the process until all net amounts are zero, meaning all debts are settled.

### Python Implementation

Here's a Python implementation of the above approach:

```python
def minimize_cash_flow(transactions):
    # Create a dictionary to store the net amount for each person
    net_amount = {}
    
    # Compute the net amount for each person
    for transaction in transactions:
        payer, payee, amount = transaction
        if payer not in net_amount:
            net_amount[payer] = 0
        if payee not in net_amount:
            net_amount[payee] = 0
        
        net_amount[payer] -= amount
        net_amount[payee] += amount
    
    # Create a list to store the result of transactions
    result = []
    
    def settle_debts():
        # Find maximum creditor and debtor
        creditors = {person: amt for person, amt in net_amount.items() if amt > 0}
        debtors = {person: amt for person, amt in net_amount.items() if amt < 0}
        
        if not creditors or not debtors:
            return
        
        # Find the maximum creditor and debtor
        max_creditor = max(creditors, key=creditors.get)
        max_debtor = max(debtors, key=lambda x: -debtors[x])
        
        max_credit = creditors[max_creditor]
        max_debit = -debtors[max_debtor]
        
        # Determine the amount to settle
        amount_to_settle = min(max_credit, max_debit)
        
        # Update net amounts
        net_amount[max_creditor] -= amount_to_settle
        net_amount[max_debtor] += amount_to_settle
        
        # Record the transaction
        result.append((max_debtor, max_creditor, amount_to_settle))
        
        # Remove settled persons from the dictionary if their net amount is zero
        if net_amount[max_creditor] == 0:
            del net_amount[max_creditor]
        if net_amount[max_debtor] == 0:
            del net_amount[max_debtor]
        
        # Recur with updated net amounts
        settle_debts()
    
    settle_debts()
    
    return result

# Example usage
transactions = [
    ('A', 'B', 100),
    ('B', 'C', 50),
    ('C', 'A', 30),
    ('D', 'A', 20),
]

result = minimize_cash_flow(transactions)
print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Compute Net Amounts**:
   - For each transaction, update the net amount for both the payer and payee.

2. **Settle Debts**:
   - Identify the maximum creditor and maximum debtor.
   - Settle the minimum of their amounts and update the net amounts.
   - Record the transaction and remove people whose net amount becomes zero.

3. **Recursion**:
   - Continue settling debts until all debts are resolved.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, where \(n\) is the number of people. This is because for each person, you may need to find the maximum creditor and debtor, and the recursive function handles updates and deletions in the dictionary.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to storing net amounts and the result list.

This algorithm effectively minimizes cash flow by ensuring that at each step, the most significant debts and credits are settled, leading to an optimal solution.
