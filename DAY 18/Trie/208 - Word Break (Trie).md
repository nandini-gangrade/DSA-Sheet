#[ Word Break (Trie)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/word-break-trie--141631/1)

The problem you're dealing with is a classic dynamic programming problem known as "Word Break." The goal is to determine whether a given string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table Initialization**: Use a boolean DP array where `dp[i]` indicates whether the substring `A[0:i]` can be segmented into dictionary words.

2. **DP Array Update**:
   - Start with `dp[0] = True` because an empty substring can always be segmented (trivially true).
   - For each position `i` in the string `A`, check every possible substring `A[j:i]` where `j` is from `0` to `i`. If `dp[j]` is `True` and `A[j:i]` is in the dictionary, set `dp[i]` to `True`.

3. **Result Extraction**: At the end of the DP array, `dp[len(A)]` will tell us if the entire string `A` can be segmented.

### Implementation

Here's the `wordBreak` function implemented using the described approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, A: str, B: list) -> int:
        word_set = set(B)  # Convert list of words into a set for O(1) lookups
        n = len(A)
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)  # DP array to store if substring A[0:i] can be segmented
        dp[0] = True  # An empty string can always be segmented
        
        # Fill the DP array
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                if dp[j] and A[j:i] in word_set:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        
        return 1 if dp[n] else 0

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.wordBreak("ilike", ["i", "like", "sam", "sung", "samsung", "mobile", "ice", "cream", "icecream", "man", "go", "mango"]))  # Output: 1
print(sol.wordBreak("ilikesamsung", ["i", "like", "sam", "sung", "samsung", "mobile", "ice", "cream", "icecream", "man", "go", "mango"]))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `word_set` is created for quick lookups.
   - `dp` array is initialized to `False` with `dp[0]` set to `True`.

2. **DP Array Update**:
   - For each position `i` in the string `A`, check all possible start positions `j`. If `dp[j]` is `True` and the substring `A[j:i]` is in the dictionary, then `dp[i]` is set to `True`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - If `dp[len(A)]` is `True`, return `1` indicating the string can be segmented; otherwise, return `0`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where `n` is the length of the string `A`. This is because for each position `i`, you potentially check all substrings ending at `i`.
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the DP array and the set storing dictionary words.

This approach efficiently determines if the string can be segmented into words from the given dictionary while meeting the problem's constraints.
