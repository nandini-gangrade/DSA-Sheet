To solve the problem of finding the least number of moves required to reach the last square in a Boustrophedon-style board, we can model the problem as a shortest path search in an unweighted graph where:

- Each square on the board represents a node.
- An edge exists between two nodes if you can move from one square to the other using a dice roll (ranging from 1 to 6).

We can use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path from the starting square (1) to the destination square (`n^2`).

### Steps to Approach

1. **Flatten the Board**:
   - Convert the 2D board into a 1D list where the index represents the square number. Adjust the traversal direction based on the row being even or odd to reflect the Boustrophedon style.
   
2. **BFS for Shortest Path**:
   - Use BFS to explore the shortest path from square 1 to square `n^2`. For each square, explore all possible moves (up to 6 squares ahead). If a square leads to a snake or ladder, move directly to the destination square. Keep track of visited squares to avoid cycles.

3. **Return the Minimum Moves**:
   - The BFS ensures that the first time we reach the last square, we have taken the minimum number of moves.

### Python Code Implementation

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def snakesAndLadders(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(board)
        
        # Convert the board to a 1D array
        def get_board_value(s):
            quot, rem = divmod(s - 1, n)
            row = n - 1 - quot
            col = rem if quot % 2 == 0 else n - 1 - rem
            return board[row][col]
        
        # BFS initialization
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([(1, 0)])  # (current square, move count)
        
        while queue:
            s, moves = queue.popleft()
            if s == n * n:
                return moves
            
            for next_s in range(s + 1, min(s + 6, n * n) + 1):
                board_value = get_board_value(next_s)
                final_s = board_value if board_value != -1 else next_s
                if final_s not in visited:
                    visited.add(final_s)
                    queue.append((final_s, moves + 1))
        
        return -1

# Example Usage:
# solution = Solution()
# result = solution.snakesAndLadders([[...]])
# print(result)
```

### Explanation

1. **Flattening the Board**:
   - The function `get_board_value(s)` takes a square number `s` and returns the corresponding board value considering the Boustrophedon pattern.

2. **BFS Execution**:
   - We initialize the BFS with the start square (1) and a move count of `0`.
   - For each square, we explore all possible next squares (from `s+1` to `min(s+6, n^2)`).
   - If a square has a ladder or snake, we move directly to the destination. We ensure each square is visited only once to avoid redundant processing.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The BFS ensures the first time we reach square `n^2`, we've taken the minimum number of moves, which is returned. If we can't reach square `n^2`, we return `-1`.

This approach is efficient and handles all the constraints given by the problem.
