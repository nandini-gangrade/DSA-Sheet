# [546. Remove Boxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-boxes/description/)

The problem you're tackling involves removing boxes of different colors to maximize the score, where you earn \( k \times k \) points for each contiguous segment of \( k \) boxes with the same color that you remove.

### Approach to Solve the Problem

The problem can be solved using **Dynamic Programming** with memoization. Here's a detailed explanation of the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming State Definition**:
   - Define a function `dp(i, j, k)` which represents the maximum points obtainable from the subarray of `boxes` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` with `k` extra boxes of the same color as `boxes[i]` at the end of this subarray.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `i > j`, it means the subarray is empty, so `dp(i, j, k) = 0`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - To compute `dp(i, j, k)`, you have two options:
     1. **Remove the contiguous segment of boxes starting at index `i` with the same color**:
        - If you remove all boxes from `i` to `m-1` where `m` is the first index greater than `i` that has a different color, you score \( (k + 1)^2 \) points.
        - You then need to compute the maximum points for the remaining segments.
     2. **Combine with segments that have the same color**:
        - For each `m` such that `boxes[m] == boxes[i]`, you can consider combining the removal of segments from `i` to `m-1` and `m` to `j`, and then recursively compute the maximum score for these segments.

4. **Memoization**:
   - Use `lru_cache` to store results of subproblems to avoid recomputation and improve efficiency.

### Python Implementation

Here's the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    def removeBoxes(self, boxes):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j, k):
            if i > j:
                return 0
            # Try removing the boxes from i to j
            max_points = (k + 1) ** 2 + dp(i + 1, j, 0)
            
            # Look for other segments with the same color
            for m in range(i + 1, j + 1):
                if boxes[m] == boxes[i]:
                    max_points = max(max_points, dp(i + 1, m - 1, 0) + dp(m, j, k + 1))
            
            return max_points

        return dp(0, len(boxes) - 1, 0)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Memoization**: The `lru_cache(None)` decorator caches results of `dp(i, j, k)` to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Recursive Function `dp(i, j, k)`**:
  - If `i > j`, the subarray is empty, so return `0`.
  - Compute the points for removing the boxes from `i` to `j` as a single segment, considering any extra `k` boxes of the same color.
  - Iterate through potential end points `m` where `boxes[m] == boxes[i]`, and calculate the maximum points by combining the results of removing the segment `[i, m-1]` and `[m, j]`.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The approach efficiently handles the problem with time complexity approximately \( O(n^3) \), where \( n \) is the number of boxes. This is manageable within the given constraints (with \( n \) up to 100).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is dominated by the memoization cache, which stores the results for each unique state `(i, j, k)`.

This implementation provides an efficient way to solve the problem by leveraging dynamic programming and memoization.
