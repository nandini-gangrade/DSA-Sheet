# [347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/)

To solve the problem of finding the `k` most frequent elements in an array, we can use a frequency-based approach, which allows us to efficiently identify the elements that appear most often.

### Approach:

1. **Count the Frequencies**:
   - First, we'll iterate through the array to count the frequency of each element using a hashmap (or dictionary in Python).

2. **Bucket Sort**:
   - Use an array of lists, where the index represents the frequency of elements. Each list at index `i` will contain all elements that appear `i` times in the input array. This is an efficient way to collect elements based on their frequency.

3. **Collect the Top `k` Frequent Elements**:
   - Since we want the `k` most frequent elements, we'll iterate through our bucket from the highest frequency to the lowest and collect the elements until we have gathered `k` elements.

### Python Implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter
from itertools import chain

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums, k):
        # Step 1: Count frequencies using Counter
        count = Counter(nums)  # A hashmap where key is the element and value is its frequency
        
        # Step 2: Initialize a bucket array where index represents frequency
        # Length of the bucket is len(nums) + 1 because the max frequency of any element can be len(nums)
        bucket = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]
        
        # Step 3: Fill the bucket
        for num, freq in count.items():
            bucket[freq].append(num)
        
        # Step 4: Flatten the bucket in reverse order and pick the first k elements
        flat_list = list(chain(*bucket[::-1]))  # Flatten and reverse bucket
        return flat_list[:k]  # Get top k elements

# Example Usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.topKFrequent([1,1,1,2,2,3], 2))  # Output: [1, 2]
print(sol.topKFrequent([1], 1))  # Output: [1]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - `Counter(nums)` efficiently counts the frequency of each element in the `nums` array.

2. **Bucket Sort**:
   - We create a `bucket` array where the index corresponds to the frequency of elements. For example, `bucket[2]` will contain all elements that appear twice in the array.

3. **Flattening the Bucket**:
   - We flatten the bucket in reverse order (from the highest frequency to the lowest) to prioritize elements with higher frequencies.

4. **Returning the Top `k` Elements**:
   - We take the first `k` elements from the flattened list, which represent the most frequent elements.

### Time Complexity:

- **Counting Frequencies**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Bucket Sort Construction**: \(O(n)\), since we're iterating through the frequency dictionary.
- **Flattening the Bucket**: \(O(n)\).
- **Overall Complexity**: \(O(n)\), which is better than \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach is optimal given the constraints and guarantees that the solution is both time and space-efficient.
