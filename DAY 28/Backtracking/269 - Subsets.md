# [78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/)

To solve the problem of generating all possible subsets (the power set) of a given list of unique integers, you can use a backtracking approach or an iterative approach. Below is a Python implementation using the backtracking method:

### Backtracking Approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        
        def backtrack(start, path):
            result.append(path[:])  # Append a copy of the current path to the result
            
            for i in range(start, len(nums)):
                path.append(nums[i])  # Include nums[i] in the current subset
                backtrack(i + 1, path)  # Recurse with the next index
                path.pop()  # Backtrack by removing the last element
        
        backtrack(0, [])
        return result
```

### Explanation:
1. **Result List**: The `result` list will store all possible subsets.
2. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function is a recursive function that explores all possible combinations starting from a given index (`start`). It takes the current subset (`path`) and extends it by adding the next element (`nums[i]`).
3. **Recursion**: After adding an element to the current subset, the function recurses to explore subsets that include the new element.
4. **Backtracking**: After exploring the subsets that include `nums[i]`, the function removes the last added element (`path.pop()`) to backtrack and explore other subsets.
5. **Base Case**: When the `start` index equals the length of `nums`, the function will have explored all possible subsets starting from that index.

### Example Usage:
```python
solution = Solution()
result = solution.subsets([1, 2, 3])
print(result)
```

### Output:
For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the output will be:
```python
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
```

### Iterative Approach:
Alternatively, you can use an iterative approach to generate all subsets by starting with the empty subset and iteratively adding elements to all existing subsets:

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = [[]]  # Start with the empty subset
        
        for num in nums:
            # For each number, add it to all existing subsets
            result += [curr + [num] for curr in result]
        
        return result
```

This iterative approach is straightforward and builds the power set by successively adding each number to the existing subsets.

Both methods will give you the correct power set of the list `nums`. The time complexity for generating all subsets is \(O(2^n \times n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`, due to the exponential number of subsets and the linear time to copy each subset.
