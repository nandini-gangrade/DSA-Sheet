# [1610. Maximum Number of Visible Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-visible-points/description/)

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points that can be viewed from a given location within a specified angle of view. The solution involves calculating the angles of the points relative to the observer's position, sorting these angles, and using a sliding window technique to find the maximum number of points that can be viewed within the given angle.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Calculate Angles for Each Point:**
   - For each point, calculate the angle it forms with the horizontal (east direction) relative to the observer's position. This can be done using the `atan2` function, which gives the angle in radians. Convert this angle to degrees.

2. **Account for Points at the Observer's Location:**
   - Count how many points are exactly at the observer's location. These points are always visible.

3. **Handle Angle Wrap Around:**
   - Since the angle is circular (0 to 360 degrees), we may need to "wrap" around the angle list. To handle this, create a second version of the angle list by adding 360 to each angle, effectively duplicating the circular behavior.

4. **Use Sliding Window:**
   - Sort the angles. Use a sliding window (two-pointer technique) to find the maximum number of points that can fit within the specified angle from any starting angle in the sorted list.

5. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Visible Points:**
   - The result is the maximum number of points seen in the sliding window plus the points at the observer's location.

### Implementation

```python
from typing import List
import math

class Solution:
    def visiblePoints(self, points: List[List[int]], angle: int, location: List[int]) -> int:
        posx, posy = location
        angles = []
        same_location_count = 0
        
        # Calculate angles
        for x, y in points:
            if x == posx and y == posy:
                same_location_count += 1
            else:
                dx = x - posx
                dy = y - posy
                # Calculate angle in degrees
                angle_in_degrees = math.degrees(math.atan2(dy, dx))
                angles.append(angle_in_degrees)
        
        # Sort angles
        angles.sort()
        
        # Duplicate the angles for wrap-around
        angles += [a + 360 for a in angles]
        
        # Use a sliding window to find the maximum number of points in the given angle
        max_points = 0
        j = 0
        n = len(angles) // 2
        
        for i in range(n):
            while j < len(angles) and angles[j] <= angles[i] + angle:
                j += 1
            # The number of points between i and j-1
            max_points = max(max_points, j - i)
        
        # Return the total max visible points
        return max_points + same_location_count
```

### Explanation

- **Angle Calculation:** We use `math.atan2(dy, dx)` to calculate the angle each point makes with the positive x-axis. This function handles all quadrants and returns the angle in radians, which we convert to degrees.
- **Sorting and Duplicate Handling:** The angles are sorted, and each angle is duplicated with an additional 360 degrees to handle circular wrap-around.
- **Sliding Window:** We use two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate over the angles and determine the maximum number of points within the specified viewing angle.
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting, where \(n\) is the number of points. The sliding window operation is \(O(n)\).

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum number of visible points within the given constraints, using the properties of angles and the circular nature of viewing directions.
